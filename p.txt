They land in a house.
A small wooden one. Quiet.
It looks safe.
There are toys scattered across the floor.
Drawings.
Names scratched into walls.
But there are no voices.
Just… stillness.
Then they see the bodies.
Children.
Dozens of them.
Some curled under blankets.
Some sitting against the walls.
None of them are bloody.
None of them look murdered.
They look like they laid down… and never got up.
There’s a note taped to the wall. Written in childish handwriting:
“Mama never eats. Mama never cries. Mama only gives.”
“So we give back. All of us.”
“If our life made her tired… then we give it back to her.”
“So she doesn’t have to carry it anymore.”
Shadow turns away.
Silver tries to scream but nothing comes out.
Sonic doesn’t blink.
Because it’s not over.
The front door creaks open.
Yukari walks in.
Not the Yukari they know — this one’s younger, quieter, smiling.
She’s carrying soup and blankets and books.
She sees them.
Her entire body goes stiff.
The pot in her hands drops. It shatters.
Then she screams.
Not magic. Not power.
She screams like a human who just watched her children kill themselves out of love.
She runs.
She grabs the first body. Cradles it. Begs it to wake up.
Then another.
And another.
She hugs them like dolls. Kisses cold foreheads. Tears open her own skin trying to shake them back.
Then she finds the plate.
It's golden. Fancy. Sacred.
And on it—meat. Prepared. Cooked.
And a note:
“We saved some of us for you.”
“Please don’t be mad.”
“If we become your food, you’ll always have strength.”
“We don’t know how to repay your love.”
“But if we go away, you won’t have to hurt anymore.”
The boys start to tremble.
But Yukari?
She kneels.
She picks up the meat.
She eats.
No hesitation.
She chews.
She swallows.
Tears running down her face.
Mouth shaking.
But she keeps eating.
Because if this is what her children gave,
then she’ll accept it.
Even if it tears her apart.
Even if she knows it’s wrong.
Even if she vomits after.
She eats.
Because she wants to respect their “gift”.
Because she thinks she deserves it.
Silver throws up.
Shadow drops to his knees and punches the floor until his hand breaks.
Sonic tries to move but can’t. He can only watch.
Then the memory ends.
They’re back in the crater.
The food is still there.
Yukari’s back is turned.
She doesn’t say anything.
